# Lyric Link
A music-centered social media web app created using Django for the purpose of discovering and sharing great music.

---

## Setup
This app uses the Spotify API when to search for tracks which requires a Spotify Developer account to get the Client and Secret IDs. For security purposes these IDs have not been included in the github repository, but can be implemented following these steps:
1. Signup for a Spotify Developer Account
2. Create an app to acquire both the Client and Secret IDs
3. Locate the "constants_template.py" within the "members" directory
4. Edit the template with the Spotify IDs
5. Rename the file to "constants.py" for correct internal referencing
